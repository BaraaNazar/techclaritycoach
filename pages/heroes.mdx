INTRODUCTION (Why We Need Tech Heroes to learn from)


Most newbie techies are seeking for one on one mentors to guide them with career roadmaps . But unfortunately most of these mentors are either active employees and founders which means one on one mentorship may not be possible. It is therefore in the best of the mentees interest to study these mentors from afar and from their activities. 

So therefore, One Of The key Objectives of our project involves bringing mentees to the table & guiding them towards accessing curated mentors to learn from without the need of one on one mentorship due to their availability dynamics. By following them on social media and gaining growth tips daily, they apply these tips to their career exactly how their mentors laid it out in their journey, this fastens growth to an extent enabling mentees to take cues without much need to wait for one on one mentorship.
